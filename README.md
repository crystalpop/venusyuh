# Zot Major

This is a project dedicated to helping high school students find the right major before college. It uses videos from the Youtube API to help students understand what a day in the life of particular majors and occupations would entail.

We used React and Flask to set up the frontend and backend. With React, we used Bootstrap and react router to make our frontend easier to interface with. For our backend, we searched up the most viewed videos with queries dependent on the major selected by the user to find the right video for them.
